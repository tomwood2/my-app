# Count Tracker

A tool to track counts of things. It can be used in two different modes.  In manual mode it is used to increment, decrement or reset a count in response to button presses.  In automated mode it counts down sets of time intervals.

## Introduction

I recently had physical therapy for a neck ailment and was directed to do at home stretching exercises where you hold a position for a specific number of seconds, take a short break and repeat for a specific number of times.  It was a bit of a pain to keep track of these counts.  At the same time I was learning React.  I though a good programming excerise would be to develop a fairly simple application to do the counting for me.  Count Tracker is the result.
